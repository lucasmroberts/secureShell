This is a hack to add a right click menu to SecureSSH and to disable right click paste. 

Copy / Paste functions are now only accessible via keyboard short cut or in a right click menu
You can also with this right click on a url to open it instead of having to copy paste it

##todo 
the righclick menu when on opened on the bottom or the far right needs to be moved up so it stays in view 

I need to tie this into the actual chrome app isntead of tacking onto generated code 

being able to follow a linewrap to get a URL would be awesome, but I am not aware of other terminals that do this

Making a url underline on mouse over would give a better UX
